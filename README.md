# CS350

I have chosen to upload my state diagram and code from the final project. The things I feel I did well were improve upon previous state diagrams, and added code that was simple and effective. I could have added more detail to my diagram, but I didn't want to lose the point or add information incorrectly. I could also improve upon the research I did to connect this thermostat to the cloud using wifi. The skills from this project that are transferrable are solving problems from multiple viewpoints, and using several methods, including coding, diagrams, videos, and written research. I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by keeping the code simple and clean.
